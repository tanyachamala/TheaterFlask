​Yes, the TheaterWebFlask application can be run in a development environment. Here's how you can set it up:​

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the project from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/vvarodi/TheaterWebFlask.git


Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the project's root directory:
cd TheaterWebFlask

Set Up a Virtual Environment: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate one as follows:
On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
py -3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
This isolates your project's dependencies from the global Python environment.


Install Dependencies: With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


This ensures all necessary libraries are available for the application.
Set Environment Variables: Configure the Flask environment variables:

On macOS/Linux:
export FLASK_APP=theater
export FLASK_ENV=development

On Windows:
set FLASK_APP=theater
set FLASK_ENV=development
Setting FLASK_ENV to development enables the debugger and allows the server to automatically reload when code changes.

Initialize the Database: The application likely uses a database. Initialize it with:
flask init-db
This command sets up the database schema and prepares it for use.

Run the Application: Start the development server:
flask run
By default, the application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Remember, the development server is intended for local development purposes only. For deployment to a production environment, consider using a production-ready server. ​
